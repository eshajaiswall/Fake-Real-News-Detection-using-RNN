# Fake-Real-News-Detection-using-RNN
**Introduction :-**
Fake news detection is a critical problem in today's digital age. This project aims to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify news articles as fake or real. RNNs are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to handle sequential data and capture the context of news articles.

**Model Training :-**
The model training process involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data, removing stop words, and tokenizing the sentences.

Model Architecture: Building an RNN model with LSTM layers to capture the sequential nature of the text data.

Training: Training the model using the preprocessed data and saving the best model based on validation performance.

**Conclusion :-**
The RNN model demonstrates strong performance in detecting fake news, highlighting its effectiveness in understanding and classifying sequential text data. While the results are promising, there is always room for improvement, particularly in handling more complex linguistic nuances and expanding the dataset.
